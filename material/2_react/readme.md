# React Basics

<cite> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces</cite>


Simply put React is a component based library for building front end UIs.

Unlike larger front end frameworks like Angular, Ember, or Meteor, React is focused only the View layer only.

What does React not have:
- A MVC architecture 
- Templates
- Event Systems
- Ajax capabilities
- Data Layer
- ...

React is a relatively simple declarative Component based language.
