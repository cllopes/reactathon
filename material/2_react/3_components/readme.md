# Components and Props

React Components are how we are able to split our UIs into smaller reusable pieces.

There are two types of Components: **Class Components** which will be covered in this section and more light weight 
**Functional Components** [see Functional Components](../TODO)


## React.Component

The first type of Components the **Class Component** can be created using ES6 Classes (see [ES6 Classes](../../1_es6/4_classes)) extending
either Reacts `Component` or `PureComponent`

```javascript 1.8
import React, { Component } from 'React'

class WelcomeMessage extends Component


```



TODO: Put note on React.createClass
