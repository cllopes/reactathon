# Reactathon
Repository contains code and examples for the Reactathon react training

## Pre Training Set Up

Required:

1. Install Node (instructions TBD)

2. Install Yarn

3. Check out code (repo TBD)

4. JavaScript IDE

    You can use any JavaScript IDE or Editor you want but for this training/hackathon I will __HIGHLY__ recommend you get the 
trial version of **WebStorm** [Download Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/).

    WebStorm is JetBrain's (creators of IntelliJ IDEA) JavaScript IDE. If you already have IntelliJ IDEA it also has the majority
    of WebStorms features already built in.
    
    Other common very good JavaScripts IDEs: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text.
    
    If you have a favorite use that, if you don't try WebStorm.

Optional

The supplied rest API is a Spring Boot application -- so if you want to poke around and modify it (which is 
encouraged) it is recommended you have the following:

1. Maven

2. Your Favorite Java IDE
