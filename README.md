# Reactathon
Repository contains code and examples for the Reactathon react training

## Pre Training Set Up

### Required:

1. Create a Github Account

1. Install Git

1. Install Node: (https://nodejs.org/en/) -- Node needs to be above > 6.0 so if you have an earlier edition you can upgrade with the installer.

1. Install Yarn with npm (node installation should have installed npm):

    `npm install -g yarn`

1. To test out your installation you can check out the sample client code and follow the read me instructions to run it:

1. JavaScript IDE

    You can use any JavaScript IDE or Editor you want but for this training/hackathon I will __HIGHLY__ recommend you get the 
trial version of **WebStorm** [Download Here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/).

    WebStorm is JetBrain's (creators of IntelliJ IDEA) JavaScript IDE. If you already have IntelliJ IDEA it also has the majority
    of WebStorms features already built in.
    
    Other common very good JavaScripts IDEs: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text.
    
    If you have a favorite use that, if you don't try WebStorm.

1. React Dev tools for chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

1. Java JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
